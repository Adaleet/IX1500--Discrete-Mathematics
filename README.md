## 1. Combinatorics and Set Theory
This project focuses on applying principles from combinatorics and set theory to solve various mathematical problems. Combinatorics, the study of counting, arrangement, and combination, provides powerful tools to solve problems related to the enumeration of possible outcomes, while set theory offers a foundational framework for handling collections of objects and relationships between them.
